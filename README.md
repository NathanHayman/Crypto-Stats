# Crypto Stats

This project uses a Crytpo API from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), with this API the application retrieves data for every crypto currency from CoinGecko. 
This data I chose in this project include: 
```
Coin Image
Coin Name
Coin Symbol
Coin Price
Coin Volume
Coin Percentage (past 24hrs)
Coin Market Cap
```
This javascript project was created using React and Axios.
The User Interface includes a serch bar in which you can search for a coin of your preference.
To see a little more of what I chose to do for the User Interface [here is a link](https://youtu.be/QWstT6ieeEo) to a demo of me running the application on my localhost!
